# Docker Security Team Mission
## About This Document
This is an automation bash script for basic Docker security, based on the 2024 KISA Docker Security Guide.
I have already separated each security section,
so you can choose and use only the parts you need.

## Warning!
This script is based on the 2024 KISA Guide.
That means it is not a perfect solution.
You should still be cautious about Docker vulnerabilities.
Also, this script was created and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Thanks to KISA!
